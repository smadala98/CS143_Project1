This is the README for the CS143 Project 1, where authors Subhodh Madala and Eric Chen worked on this project. This project required us to implement SQL Tables, load the information to them, and also create a web interface with PHP so that we can submit queries that would return an HTML page with those results listed. To test it, you'll have to perform the following commands:
1) ssh localhost -p 1432 -l cs143  #SSH into the CS143 server
2) Run the sql scripts
3) php -S localhost:1438  #Get the Apache Server running to utilize our HTML & Script
4) Try a Query and Submit!
